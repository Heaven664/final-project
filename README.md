## **Future Development**

Wish Whisper is a newly launched project, and we understand the importance of providing a usable platform as quickly as possible. However, we acknowledge that certain crucial features are currently missing. We want to assure you that we are actively working on delivering these features in the near future. Stay tuned as we continue to enhance Wish Whisper to meet your expectations.

### **Friend Request**

We understand the frustration caused by the current functionality that allows adding people to our platform without their consent. We acknowledge that this is not an ideal experience, and we want to assure you that addressing this issue is our top priority. We are actively working on a solution to fix this and provide a more user-friendly experience. Thank you for your patience as we strive to improve our platform.

### <span style="color:#3498DB">**Active Now**</span>

At Wish Whisper, we recognize the significance of keeping track of your friends' activity on our platform. We understand that having the ability to see who is currently active is an awesome feature that can greatly enhance your social networking experience. We are thrilled to announce that implementing this feature is one of our top priorities in the upcoming updates.

### <span style="color:#3498DB">**Live Feed**</span>

At Wish Whisper our goal is to create a warm and inviting platform for you and your friends, where you can freely share your thoughts, photos, and videos. We strive to provide a cozy space where you can engage with your social circle and express yourself through various forms of media.

### **More and More**

We are committed to providing our users with the best and most up-to-date features of modern web communication.

3. Inside the project directory, you will find two main directories: `express-backend` and `react-frontend`.

4. First, let's set up the Express backend:

- Navigate to the `express-backend` directory:

  ```
  cd express-backend
  ```

- Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` file. Update the configuration settings as needed.

- Install the dependencies by running the following command:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

- Once the dependencies are installed, start the backend server:
  ```
  npm start
  ```

5. Now, let's set up the React frontend: 

- Open a new terminal or command prompt window.

- Navigate to the `react-frontend` directory:

  ```
  cd ../react-frontend
  ```
